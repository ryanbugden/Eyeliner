# Eyeliner


RoboFont extension that highlights points and anchors that are aligned with vertical font dimensions, 0°/90° guides, or blue zones (if set to be visible). Rest assured that your points are aligned, without having to zoom in and check (;

Eyeline shapes will match the appropriate color of whatever line it's aligning to, based on the color preferences you have set in RoboFont.
