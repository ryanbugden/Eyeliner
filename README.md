# Eyeliner


RoboFont extension that highlights points and anchors that are aligned with vertical font dimensions, guidelines, or blue zones (if set to be visible). Rest assured that your points are aligned, without having to zoom in and check (;

Eyeliner shapes will match the appropriate color of whatever line it's aligning to, based on the color preferences you have set in RoboFont.
